# Absenteeism-Project-Analysis
Absenteeism data analysis is done to figure out the reasons and patterns behind people missing work or school. The goal is to explain why it happens, predict when itâ€™s likely to occur, and find ways to cut down on unnecessary absences. By doing this, organizations can run more smoothly while also supporting the well-being of their employees.
